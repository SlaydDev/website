    <p>This is actually my ninth try getting this blog auto-poster to work properly. Basically, it’s supposed to grab files from a Google Doc and automatically format them with an author and the body text—pretty tricky, if you ask me. That’s all for this post, but future ones will have more info and hopefully better quality!</p>
